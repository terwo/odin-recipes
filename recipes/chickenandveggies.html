    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>The only home-cooked meal I <strong>ever</strong> made since coming to Japan. It's high in protein and nutrients, allowing me to somewhat reach my daily protein intake goals.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Broccoli</li>
        <li>A singular tomato</li>
        <li>Chicken</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li><em>Virgin</em> oil</li>
        <li>A lot of spices</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Microwave that broccoli</li>
        <li>Heat up the stove, cut some garlic and put that in a oiled pan</li>
        <li>Cut up that chicken -- thinner is better</li>
        <li>To your heart's content, sprinkle as much spices on that thing as you want</li>
        <li>Cut up some tomatoes and pop that in too</li>
        <li>Mixey mixey yum yum</li>
        <li>Splash some milk onto the horror in front of you to make it <strong>creamier</strong></li>
