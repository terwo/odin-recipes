    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Known as <em>fan chie ji dan</em> in Mandarin, this is a household classic dish that is both nutritious and appetizing.
        My parents always made this for me growing up, so it has an important place in my heart.</p>
    <p>The following ingredients and steps are adapted from <a href="https://christieathome.com/blog/chinese-tomato-egg-stir-fry/">Christie At Home</a>.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Roma tomatoes</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Green onions</li>
        <li>Sesame oil</li>
        <li>Water</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, crack your eggs and add sesame oil. Beat the eggs & sesame oil for 20-30 seconds.</li>
        <li>In a pan set on medium heat, add 1 teaspoon of oil. Once oil is hot, add beaten eggs. Cook by stirring and folding in the edges until eggs take shape and glossy in the center. Remove them from the pan.</li>
        <li>Back into the pan, add remaining oil and green onions. Cook for 5 seconds or until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add tomatoes and water. Allow the tomatoes to cook for 2-3 minutes until they have softened, and skin begins to peel away.</li>
        <li>Pour sauce over tomatoes. Allow sauce to simmer & thicken slightly, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Once slightly thicker, add eggs and gently fold them into the sauce and tomatoes. Remove from heat. Serve & enjoy. <strong>Optional: garnish with more green onions</strong>.</li>
    </ol>
